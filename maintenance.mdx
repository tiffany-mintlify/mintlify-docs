This article covers strategies for keeping your documentation accurate and valuable over time, from automated checks to content lifecycles.

### **Automate what you can**

Documentation rot happens because updating is often too manual and time-consuming. Try to introduce automations where you can.

A few ideas:

- **Track stale content:** Run a script to flag important docs that haven’t been updated in X days.
- **Detect product changes:** If your documentation relies on artifacts from engineering (e.g., OpenAPI specs), set up a job to detect when key objects change and notify the team. Or, use a documentation provider that [auto-generates APIs](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup#openapi-setup) and automatically updates.
- **Enforce standards with linters:** Use [Vale.sh](http://Vale.sh) or [a documentation provider](https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/ci) to automatically catch formatting issues, writing style deviations, or missing metadata on every pull request.

### **Set up realistic review processes**

Documentation will never be perfect, and that’s okay. You should have a threshold of acceptance—a level where docs are functional and useful. 

Instead of aiming for 100%, balance efficiency with quality:

- **Trigger reviews based on relevance, not just time.** Rather than setting periodic updates, prioritize content based on usage, search demand, or product changes.
- **Focus on high-impact docs.** Not every page needs regular updates, but the 10 most viewed pages for users should get extra attention.
- **Lean on your community.** If your docs are open-source, empower users to flag issues or submit fixes via pull requests—it builds trust and keeps content fresh. Incorporate feedback mechanisms in your docs when you can.

### Know when to rewrite

Over time, documentation naturally accumulates caveats and workarounds, leading to “spaghetti docs.” When incremental fixes create more confusion than clarity, a full overhaul may be the best option.

- **Plan for periodic resets.** Every 1-2 years, consider a major cleanup, especially if best practices or the product itself has evolved significantly.
- **Start with a structured audit.** Interview support teams, analyze user feedback, and document what’s missing, misleading, or redundant before rewriting.
- **Tackle rewrites in focused sprints.** A full overhaul doesn’t have to happen all at once—prioritize sections with the biggest impact.

### **Wrong docs can be worse than no docs**

Outdated or misleading documentation wastes users’ time and erodes trust. In cases where a doc is completely inaccurate and unfixable in the short term, it’s often better to remove it entirely. Users will appreciate having less information over having wrong information.
