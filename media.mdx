Screenshots, GIFs, and videos can enhance documentation but require ongoing maintenance as UI elements change. Use them selectively to avoid unnecessary upkeep.

Key guidelines:

- **Media should be supplementary.** If a workflow is clear in text alone, avoid adding visuals.
- **Ensure accessibility.** Add alt text for images, subtitles for videos, and transcripts for audio content. Over 2 billion people use assistive technology, and accessibility features benefit all users.
- **Balance clarity with maintainability.** Frequent UI changes can make screenshots and videos outdated quickly. Consider whether the effort to update them is worth the value they add.

The following table contains media guidelines & time required to update, courtesy of Idan Englander, Manager of Technical Writing at Anaconda:

| Media Type  | When to use                                          | Example                                        | Time |
|:------------|:-----------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|:------------------------|
| Screenshots | For tasks that are difficult to explain with words  | UI element (such as a button or dropdown) is hidden or obscure | ~5 min  |
| GIFs        | For promotional purposes and short yet complex workflows | Product changelog  | ~1 hour  |
| Videos      | For abstract concepts and long workflows            | Tutorials                                      | Several hours  |


Use media sparingly and intentionally to avoid unnecessary documentation debt. When done right, it enhances comprehension without adding maintenance burdens or accessibility barriers.
