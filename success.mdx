This article covers how to measure the success of your documentation with a balanced approach, blending quantitative metrics, qualitative feedback, and alignment with business goals.

### Context matters for quantitative metrics

You can track general metrics such as page views or bounce rates, but you need to assess whether these indicators are meaningful in the context of your goals.

For example,

- **Page views**: Views can be a good proxy for success, but it could be driven by bot traffic or repeat visitors. Or if you’re getting a lot of views on an errors or explainer page, it might signal an issue with your broader product.
- **Time on page**: Longer time on page might signal engagement, but it could also mean users are stuck trying to find the information they need.
- **Click-through rate (CTR)**: A higher CTR on links or CTAs might indicate user engagement, but it’s important to ensure the clicks are actually guiding users to the right resources and not just diverting them elsewhere.

“In general, don’t fall into the trap that a bigger number means better performance.” —Ethan Palm, Senior Manager of Docs at GitHub

The key is to compare these metrics over time or against a baseline to spot trends and understand if they truly align with users achieving their goals.

### Use qualitative feedback to add depth

Add more context to your quantitative metrics with qualitative information such as:

- **User feedback**: Incorporate ratings and open-ended surveys to capture user sentiment, helping you understand what works and where they struggle.
- **Stakeholder input**: Get regular feedback from teams like support, engineering, and customer success to uncover common issues users face and areas for improvement.
- **User testing**: Conduct usability tests to validate whether users are able to find the answers they need and whether your documentation aligns with their expectations. See “Know Your Audience” [hyperlink]

### **Align with business goals**

You can measure documentation against broader business objectives.  

Some example goals:

- **Support efficiency**: Track whether your documentation reduces the volume of support tickets or improves satisfaction scores, indicating it's meeting user needs.
- **Onboarding and adoption**: Monitor how well documentation supports new users in getting up to speed, contributing to faster product adoption.
- **Retention**: Well-maintained, easy-to-follow docs contribute to positive user experiences, helping to reduce churn and improve retention rates.
