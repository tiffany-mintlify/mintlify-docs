This article covers stylistic choices, common pitfalls, and practical implementation tips for writing technical documentation. 

## Writing principles

- **Be concise.** People aren’t reading docs for fun; they want to achieve a goal. Cut all unnecessary words.
- **Clarity over cleverness.** Be simple, direct, and avoid jargon or complex sentence structure.
- **Use active voice.** Instead of saying “A configuration file should be created,” use “Create a configuration file.”
- **Be skimmable.** Use headlines to orient structure. Break up text-heavy paragraphs.
- **Write in second person.** Referring to your reader makes it feel like the documentation is written for them.

## Common writing mistakes

- **Don’t have spelling & grammar mistakes.** “Grammatical errors may seem small, but they’re a key indicator of quality. They can degrade trust in your product as well.” —Brody Klapko, Technical Writer at Stash
- **Avoid inconsistency in terminology.** Calling something an “API key” in one paragraph then “API token” in the next makes it much more difficult for users.

<Note>
    "Consistency is key! You may not be complimented on your consistency, but people will absolutely notice and be frustrated by a lack thereof.” 
    
    —CT Smith, Head of Docs at Payabli

- **Don’t use product-centric terminology.** Your users don’t have the full context of your product (see [“Know Your Audience”](/know_your_audience)). Always orient language around the user’s familiarity with your product and what they’re trying to achieve.
- **Avoid “Duh” documentation.** Don’t tell users “Click Save to save.” Documentation should add value, not outline obvious steps.
- **No colloquialisms.** Especially for localization, colloquialisms hurt clarity.

## Tips for enforcing style

Leverage existing style guides to standardize your documentation:

- [Microsoft Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/)
- [Splunk Style Guide](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/StyleGuide/current/StyleGuide/Howtouse)
- [Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style)

When you know which writing principles you want to implement, automate as much as you can. You can use linters (such as [Vale](https://vale.sh)) or your documentation provider, such as Mintlify’s [CI checks](https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/ci).
